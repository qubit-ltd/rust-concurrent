/// Asynchronous Read-Write Lock Wrapper
///
/// Provides an encapsulation of asynchronous read-write lock,
/// supporting multiple read operations or a single write operation.
/// Read operations can execute concurrently, while write operations
/// have exclusive access.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - Supports multiple concurrent read operations
/// - Write operations have exclusive access, mutually exclusive with
///   read operations
/// - Asynchronously acquires locks, does not block threads
/// - Thread-safe, supports multi-threaded sharing
/// - Automatic lock management through RAII ensures proper lock
///   release
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// Suitable for read-heavy scenarios such as caching, configuration
/// management, etc.
///
/// # Usage Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use qubit_concurrent::lock::{ArcAsyncRwLock, AsyncLock};
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     let data = ArcAsyncRwLock::new(String::from("Hello"));
///
///     // Multiple read operations can execute concurrently
///     data.read(|s| {
///         println!("Read: {}", s);
///     }).await;
///
///     // Write operations have exclusive access
///     data.write(|s| {
///         s.push_str(" World!");
///         println!("Write: {}", s);
///     }).await;
/// }
/// ```
