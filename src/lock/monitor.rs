//! # Monitor
//!
//! Provides a synchronous monitor built from a mutex and a condition variable.
//! A monitor protects one shared state value and lets threads wait until that
//! state satisfies a predicate.

/// Shared state protected by a mutex and a condition variable.
///
/// `Monitor` is useful when callers need more than a short critical section.
/// It models the classic monitor pattern: one mutex protects the state, and
/// one condition variable lets threads wait until that state changes. Waiting
/// is always predicate based, so spurious wakeups are handled by rechecking the
/// predicate before the caller's closure runs.
///
/// A poisoned mutex is recovered by taking the inner state. This makes
/// `Monitor` suitable for coordination state that should remain observable
/// after another thread panics while holding the lock.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T` - The state protected by this monitor.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::thread;
///
/// use qubit_concurrent::lock::ArcMonitor;
///
/// let monitor = ArcMonitor::new(false);
/// let waiter_monitor = monitor.clone();
///
/// let waiter = thread::spawn(move || {
///     waiter_monitor.wait_until(
///         |ready| *ready,
///         |ready| {
///             *ready = false;
///         },
///     );
/// });
///
/// monitor.write(|ready| {
///     *ready = true;
/// });
/// monitor.notify_all();
///
/// waiter.join().expect("waiter should finish");
/// assert!(!monitor.read(|ready| *ready));
/// ```
