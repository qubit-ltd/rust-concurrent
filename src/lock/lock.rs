/// Unified synchronous lock trait
///
/// Provides a unified interface for different types of synchronous locks,
/// supporting both read and write operations. This trait allows locks to be
/// used in a generic way through closures, avoiding the complexity of
/// explicitly managing lock guards and their lifetimes.
///
/// # Design Philosophy
///
/// This trait unifies both exclusive locks (like `Mutex`) and read-write
/// locks (like `RwLock`) under a single interface. The key insight is that
/// all locks can be viewed as supporting two operations:
///
/// - **Read operations**: Provide immutable access (`&T`) to the data
/// - **Write operations**: Provide mutable access (`&mut T`) to the data
///
/// For exclusive locks (Mutex), both read and write operations acquire the
/// same exclusive lock, but the API clearly indicates the intended usage.
/// For read-write locks (RwLock), read operations use shared locks while
/// write operations use exclusive locks.
///
/// This design enables:
/// - Unified API across different lock types
/// - Clear semantic distinction between read and write operations
/// - Generic code that works with any lock type
/// - Performance optimization through appropriate lock selection
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// Different lock implementations have different performance characteristics:
///
/// ## Mutex-based locks (ArcMutex, Mutex)
/// - `read`: Acquires exclusive lock, same performance as write
/// - `write`: Acquires exclusive lock, same performance as read
/// - **Use case**: When you need exclusive access or don't know access patterns
///
/// ## RwLock-based locks (ArcRwLock, RwLock)
/// - `read`: Acquires shared lock, allows concurrent readers
/// - `write`: Acquires exclusive lock, blocks all other operations
/// - **Use case**: Read-heavy workloads where multiple readers can proceed
///   concurrently
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T` - The type of data protected by the lock
///
/// # Author
///
/// Haixing Hu
pub trait Lock<T: ?Sized> {
    /// Acquires a read lock and executes a closure
    ///
    /// This method provides immutable access to the protected data. For
    /// exclusive locks (Mutex), this acquires the same exclusive lock as
    /// write operations. For read-write locks (RwLock), this acquires a
    /// shared lock allowing concurrent readers.
    ///
    /// # Use Cases
    ///
    /// - **Data inspection**: Reading values, checking state, validation
    /// - **Read-only operations**: Computing derived values, formatting output
    /// - **Condition checking**: Evaluating predicates without modification
    /// - **Logging and debugging**: Accessing data for diagnostic purposes
    ///
    /// # Performance Notes
    ///
    /// - **Mutex-based locks**: Same performance as write operations
    /// - **RwLock-based locks**: Allows concurrent readers, better for
    ///   read-heavy workloads
    ///
    /// # Arguments

    ///   protected data
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Returns the result produced by the closure
    ///
    /// # Example

    ///
    /// let lock = ArcRwLock::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    ///
    /// // Read operation - allows concurrent readers with RwLock
    /// let len = lock.read(|data| data.len());
    /// assert_eq!(len, 3);
    ///
    /// // Multiple concurrent readers possible with RwLock
    /// let sum = lock.read(|data| data.iter().sum::<i32>());
    /// assert_eq!(sum, 6);

    /// # Use Cases
    ///
    /// - **Data modification**: Updating values, adding/removing elements

    /// - **Initialization**: Setting up data structures
    /// - **Cleanup operations**: Releasing resources, resetting state
    ///
