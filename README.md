A comprehensive Rust concurrent utilities library providing thread-safe lock wrappers and synchronization primitives for the Prism3 ecosystem.

## Overview

Prism3 Concurrent provides easy-to-use wrappers around both synchronous and asynchronous locks, offering a unified interface for concurrent programming in Rust. All lock types have `Arc` built-in internally, so you can clone and share them across threads or tasks directly without additional wrapping. The library provides convenient helper methods for common locking patterns with a closure-based API that ensures proper lock management.

## Features

### 🔒 **Synchronous Locks**
- **ArcMutex**: Thread-safe mutual exclusion lock wrapper with `Arc` integration
- **ArcRwLock**: Thread-safe read-write lock wrapper supporting multiple concurrent readers
- **Convenient API**: `with_lock` and `try_with_lock` methods for cleaner lock handling
- **Automatic RAII**: Ensures proper lock release through scope-based management

### 🚀 **Asynchronous Locks**
- **ArcAsyncMutex**: Async-aware mutual exclusion lock for use with Tokio runtime
- **ArcAsyncRwLock**: Async-aware read-write lock supporting concurrent async reads
- **Non-blocking**: Designed for async contexts without blocking threads
- **Tokio Integration**: Built on top of Tokio's synchronization primitives

### 🎯 **Key Benefits**
- **Clone Support**: All lock wrappers implement `Clone` for easy sharing across threads
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Rust's type system for compile-time guarantees
- **Ergonomic API**: Closure-based lock access eliminates common pitfalls
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested locking patterns with comprehensive test coverage

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
prism3-concurrent = "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start

### Synchronous Mutex

```rust
use prism3_concurrent::ArcMutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = ArcMutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Spawn multiple threads that increment the counter
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = counter.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            counter.with_lock(|value| {
                *value += 1;
            });
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all threads
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Read final value
    let result = counter.with_lock(|value| *value);
    println!("Final counter: {}", result); // Prints: Final counter: 10
}
```

### Synchronous Read-Write Lock

```rust
use prism3_concurrent::ArcRwLock;

fn main() {
    let data = ArcRwLock::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);

    // Multiple concurrent reads
    let data1 = data.clone();
    let data2 = data.clone();

    let handle1 = std::thread::spawn(move || {
        let len = data1.with_read_lock(|v| v.len());
        println!("Length from thread 1: {}", len);
    });

    let handle2 = std::thread::spawn(move || {
        let len = data2.with_read_lock(|v| v.len());
        println!("Length from thread 2: {}", len);
    });

    // Exclusive write access
    data.with_write_lock(|v| {
        v.push(4);
        println!("Added element, new length: {}", v.len());
    });

    handle1.join().unwrap();
    handle2.join().unwrap();
}
```

### Asynchronous Mutex

```rust
use prism3_concurrent::ArcAsyncMutex;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let counter = ArcAsyncMutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Spawn multiple async tasks
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = counter.clone();
        let handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
            counter.with_lock(|value| {
                *value += 1;
            }).await;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all tasks
    for handle in handles {
        handle.await.unwrap();
    }

    // Read final value
    let result = counter.with_lock(|value| *value).await;
    println!("Final counter: {}", result); // Prints: Final counter: 10
}
```

### Asynchronous Read-Write Lock

```rust
use prism3_concurrent::ArcAsyncRwLock;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let data = ArcAsyncRwLock::new(String::from("Hello"));

    // Concurrent async reads
    let data1 = data.clone();
    let data2 = data.clone();

    let handle1 = tokio::spawn(async move {
        let content = data1.with_read_lock(|s| s.clone()).await;
        println!("Read from task 1: {}", content);
    });

    let handle2 = tokio::spawn(async move {
        let content = data2.with_read_lock(|s| s.clone()).await;
        println!("Read from task 2: {}", content);
    });

    // Exclusive async write
    data.with_write_lock(|s| {
        s.push_str(" World!");
        println!("Updated string: {}", s);
    }).await;

    handle1.await.unwrap();
    handle2.await.unwrap();
}
```

### Try Lock (Non-blocking)

```rust
use prism3_concurrent::ArcMutex;

fn main() {
    let mutex = ArcMutex::new(42);

    // Try to acquire lock without blocking
    match mutex.try_with_lock(|value| *value) {
        Some(v) => println!("Got value: {}", v),
        None => println!("Lock is busy"),
    }
}
```

## Design Patterns

### Closure-Based Lock Access

All locks use closure-based access patterns for several benefits:

1. **Automatic Release**: Lock is automatically released when closure completes
2. **Exception Safety**: Lock is released even if closure panics
3. **Reduced Boilerplate**: No need to manually manage lock guards
4. **Clear Scope**: Lock scope is explicitly defined by closure boundaries

### Arc Integration

**Important**: All `ArcMutex`, `ArcRwLock`, `ArcAsyncMutex`, and `ArcAsyncRwLock` types already have `Arc` integrated internally. You don't need to wrap them with `Arc` again.

```rust
// ✅ Correct - use directly
let lock = ArcMutex::new(0);
let lock_clone = lock.clone();  // Clones the internal Arc

// ❌ Wrong - unnecessary double wrapping
let lock = Arc::new(ArcMutex::new(0));  // Don't do this!
```

This design provides several benefits:

1. **Easy Cloning**: Share locks across threads/tasks with simple `.clone()`
2. **No Extra Wrapping**: Use directly without additional `Arc` allocation
3. **Reference Counting**: Automatic cleanup when last reference is dropped
4. **Type Safety**: Compiler ensures proper usage patterns

## Use Cases

### 1. Shared Counter

Perfect for maintaining shared state across multiple threads:

```rust
let counter = ArcMutex::new(0);
// Share counter across threads
let counter_clone = counter.clone();
thread::spawn(move || {
    counter_clone.with_lock(|c| *c += 1);
});
```

### 2. Configuration Cache

Read-write locks are ideal for configuration that's read frequently but written rarely:

```rust
let config = ArcRwLock::new(Config::default());

// Many readers
config.with_read_lock(|cfg| println!("Port: {}", cfg.port));

// Occasional writer
config.with_write_lock(|cfg| cfg.port = 8080);
```

### 3. Async Task Coordination

Coordinate state between async tasks without blocking threads:

```rust
let state = ArcAsyncMutex::new(TaskState::Idle);
let state_clone = state.clone();

tokio::spawn(async move {
    state_clone.with_lock(|s| *s = TaskState::Running).await;
    // ... do work ...
    state_clone.with_lock(|s| *s = TaskState::Complete).await;
});
```

## Dependencies

- **tokio**: Async runtime and synchronization primitives (features: `sync`)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with coverage report
./coverage.sh

# Generate text format report
./coverage.sh text

# Generate detailed HTML report
./coverage.sh html
```

### Coverage Tool Information

The coverage statistics are generated using `cargo-llvm-cov`. For more details on how to run coverage tests and interpret results, see:

- [COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md) - English coverage documentation
- [COVERAGE.zh_CN.md](COVERAGE.zh_CN.md) - Chinese coverage documentation
- Project coverage reports in `target/llvm-cov/html/`

## Performance Considerations

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

- **Synchronous locks** (`ArcMutex`, `ArcRwLock`): Use for CPU-bound operations or when already in a thread-based context
- **Asynchronous locks** (`ArcAsyncMutex`, `ArcAsyncRwLock`): Use within async contexts to avoid blocking the executor

### Read-Write Locks

Read-write locks (`ArcRwLock`, `ArcAsyncRwLock`) are beneficial when:
- Read operations significantly outnumber writes
- Read operations are relatively expensive
- Multiple readers can genuinely execute in parallel

For simple, fast operations or equal read/write patterns, regular mutexes may be simpler and faster.
