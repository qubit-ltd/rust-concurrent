/// Synchronous Read-Write Lock Wrapper
///
/// Provides an encapsulation of synchronous read-write lock,
/// supporting multiple read operations or a single write operation.
/// Read operations can execute concurrently, while write operations
/// have exclusive access.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - Supports multiple concurrent read operations
/// - Write operations have exclusive access, mutually exclusive with
///   read operations
/// - Synchronously acquires locks, may block threads
/// - Thread-safe, supports multi-threaded sharing
/// - Automatic lock management through RAII ensures proper lock
///   release
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// Suitable for read-heavy scenarios such as caching, configuration
/// management, etc.
///
/// # Usage Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use qubit_concurrent::lock::{ArcRwLock, Lock};
///
/// let data = ArcRwLock::new(String::from("Hello"));
///
/// // Multiple read operations can execute concurrently
/// data.read(|s| {
///     println!("Read: {}", s);
/// });
///
/// // Write operations have exclusive access
/// data.write(|s| {
///     s.push_str(" World!");
///     println!("Write: {}", s);
/// });
/// ```
