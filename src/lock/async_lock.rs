/// Unified asynchronous lock trait
///
/// Provides a unified interface for different types of asynchronous
/// locks, supporting both read and write operations. This trait allows
/// locks to be used in async contexts through closures, avoiding the
/// complexity of explicitly managing lock guards and their lifetimes.
///
/// # Design Philosophy
///
/// This trait unifies both exclusive async locks (like `tokio::sync::Mutex`)
/// and read-write async locks (like `tokio::sync::RwLock`) under a single
/// interface. The key insight is that all async locks can be viewed as
/// supporting two operations:
///
/// - **Read operations**: Provide immutable access (`&T`) to the data
/// - **Write operations**: Provide mutable access (`&mut T`) to the data
///
/// For exclusive async locks (Mutex), both read and write operations
/// acquire the same exclusive lock, but the API clearly indicates the
/// intended usage. For read-write async locks (RwLock), read operations
/// use shared locks while write operations use exclusive locks.
///
/// This design enables:
/// - Unified API across different async lock types
/// - Clear semantic distinction between read and write operations
/// - Generic async code that works with any lock type
/// - Performance optimization through appropriate lock selection
/// - Non-blocking async operations
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// Different async lock implementations have different performance
/// characteristics:
///
/// ## Mutex-based async locks (ArcAsyncMutex, AsyncMutex)
/// - `read`: Acquires exclusive lock, same performance as write
/// - `write`: Acquires exclusive lock, same performance as read
/// - **Use case**: When you need exclusive access or don't know access
///   patterns
///
/// ## RwLock-based async locks (ArcAsyncRwLock, AsyncRwLock)
/// - `read`: Acquires shared lock, allows concurrent readers
/// - `write`: Acquires exclusive lock, blocks all other operations
/// - **Use case**: Read-heavy async workloads where multiple readers can
///   proceed concurrently
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T` - The type of data protected by the lock
///
/// # Author
///

pub trait AsyncLock<T: ?Sized> {
    /// Acquires a read lock asynchronously and executes a closure
    ///
    /// This method awaits until a read lock can be acquired without
    /// blocking the thread, then executes the provided closure with
    /// immutable access to the protected data. For exclusive async
    /// locks (Mutex), this acquires the same exclusive lock as write
    /// operations. For read-write async locks (RwLock), this acquires
    /// a shared lock allowing concurrent readers.
    ///
    /// # Use Cases
    ///
    /// - **Data inspection**: Reading values, checking state, validation
    /// - **Read-only operations**: Computing derived values, formatting
    ///   output
    /// - **Condition checking**: Evaluating predicates without modification
    /// - **Logging and debugging**: Accessing data for diagnostic purposes
    ///
    /// # Performance Notes
    ///
    /// - **Mutex-based async locks**: Same performance as write operations
    /// - **RwLock-based async locks**: Allows concurrent readers, better
    ///   for read-heavy async workloads
    ///
    /// # Arguments
