/// Managed task service with submission and lifecycle control.

/// `ExecutorService` is intentionally separate from
/// [`Executor`](crate::task::executor::Executor). An executor describes an
/// execution strategy; an executor service accepts tasks into a managed service
/// that may queue, schedule, assign workers, and track lifecycle.
///
/// `submit` and `submit_callable` return `Result` values whose outer `Ok`
/// means only that the service accepted the task. It does **not** mean the task
/// has started or succeeded. The task's final result is observed through the
/// returned handle.
