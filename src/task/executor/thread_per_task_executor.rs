/// Executes each task on a dedicated OS thread.
///
/// This executor does not manage lifecycle or maintain a queue. Each accepted
/// task receives a [`TaskHandle`] that can be used to wait for the result.
///
/// # Semantics
///
/// * **One task, one thread** — each [`Executor::call`] or [`Executor::execute`]
///   spawns a new [`std::thread::spawn`] worker. There is no pool and no
///   submission queue.
/// * **Blocking or async wait** — [`TaskHandle::get`] blocks the calling thread,
///   while awaiting the handle uses a waker and does not block the polling
///   thread.
/// * **Completion probe** — [`TaskHandle::is_done`] reads an atomic flag set
///   after the worker publishes the result; it does not retrieve the value
///   (you still need [`TaskHandle::get`] for that).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::io;
///
/// use qubit_concurrent::task::executor::{
///     Executor,
///     ThreadPerTaskExecutor,
/// };
///
/// let executor = ThreadPerTaskExecutor;
/// let handle = executor.call(|| Ok::<i32, io::Error>(40 + 2));
///
/// // Blocks the current thread until the spawned thread completes.
/// let value = handle.get().expect("task should succeed");
/// assert_eq!(value, 42);
/// ```
