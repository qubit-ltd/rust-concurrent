/// Runnable task trait
///
/// Represents a task that can be executed. Similar to the `Runnable` interface in JDK.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use prism3_concurrent::Runnable;
///
/// struct MyTask {
///     name: String,
/// }
///
/// impl Runnable for MyTask {
///     fn run(&self) {
///         println!("Task {} is executing", self.name);
///     }
/// }
///
/// let task = MyTask {
///     name: String::from("task-1"),
/// };
/// task.run();
/// ```

/// # Author

///
pub trait Runnable: Send {

    ///
    /// This method will be called when the task is scheduled for execution by the executor.

/// Callable task trait that returns a result
///
/// Represents a computation task that can return a result. Similar to the `Callable` interface in JDK.
/// Unlike `Runnable`, `Callable` can return a computation result or an error.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T` - The result type returned by the task
/// * `E` - The error type that the task may produce
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use prism3_concurrent::Callable;
///
/// struct ComputeTask {
///     x: i32,
///     y: i32,
/// }
///
/// impl Callable<i32, String> for ComputeTask {

///         if self.y == 0 {
///             Err(String::from("Divisor cannot be zero"))
///         } else {

///         }

/// let task = ComputeTask { x: 10, y: 2 };
/// match task.call() {
///     Ok(result) => println!("Computation result: {}", result),
///     Err(e) => println!("Computation error: {}", e),

/// Synchronous task executor trait
///
/// Provides functionality similar to the JDK `Executor` interface for executing submitted synchronous tasks.
/// The executor is responsible for decoupling the execution of tasks from their submission, so that
/// task submitters do not need to worry about how tasks are executed, which thread they run on, etc.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - Decouples task submission and execution: Task submitters only need to submit tasks without worrying about execution details
/// - Flexible execution strategies: Implementors can freely choose synchronous execution, thread pool execution, and other strategies
/// - Focuses on synchronous tasks: Only handles regular closure tasks, not async Futures
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Thread pools: Submit tasks to a thread pool for execution
/// - Task schedulers: Schedule task execution based on priority, delay, and other policies
/// - CPU-intensive computation: Execute computationally intensive synchronous tasks
/// - Testing environment: Use synchronous executors in tests for easier debugging and verification
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use prism3_concurrent::Executor;
///
/// struct SimpleExecutor;
///
/// impl Executor for SimpleExecutor {
///     fn execute(&self, task: Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>) {
///         // Simple synchronous execution
///         task();
///     }
/// }
///
/// let executor = SimpleExecutor;
/// executor.execute(Box::new(|| {
///     println!("Synchronous task executing");
/// }));
/// ```
///
/// # Author
///
/// Haixing Hu
///
pub trait Executor: Send + Sync {
    /// Executes the given synchronous task
    ///
    /// Submits the task to the executor for execution. The task may be executed synchronously
    /// on the current thread, or asynchronously on another thread, depending on the implementor's strategy.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// * `task` - The synchronous task to be executed, which must implement the `Send` trait for transfer between threads
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// use prism3_concurrent::Executor;
    ///
    /// let executor = create_executor();
    /// executor.execute(Box::new(|| {
    ///     println!("Task is executing");
    /// }));
    /// ```
    fn execute(&self, task: Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>);
}

/// Asynchronous task executor trait
///
/// Provides asynchronous task execution functionality, specifically for executing async Future tasks.
/// Separated from `Executor`, following the single responsibility principle.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - Focuses on asynchronous tasks: Only handles async Futures, not synchronous closures
/// - Non-blocking execution: Tasks execute in an async runtime without blocking threads
/// - Efficient concurrency: Multiple async tasks can share a small number of threads
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Asynchronous I/O operations: Network requests, file I/O, etc.
/// - Concurrent task coordination: Requires large amounts of concurrent async operations
/// - Microservice calls: Asynchronously call multiple services and aggregate results
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use prism3_concurrent::AsyncExecutor;
///
/// struct SimpleAsyncExecutor;
///
/// impl AsyncExecutor for SimpleAsyncExecutor {
///     fn spawn<F>(&self, future: F)
///     where
///         F: Future<Output = ()> + Send + 'static,
///     {
///         // Spawn task in tokio runtime
///         tokio::spawn(future);
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     let executor = SimpleAsyncExecutor;
///     executor.spawn(async {
///         println!("Async task is executing");
///     });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Author
///
/// Haixing Hu
///

    ///
    /// Submits an async task to the executor for execution. The task will be executed
    /// in the async runtime managed by the executor, without blocking the current thread.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// * `future` - The async task to be executed
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// use prism3_concurrent::AsyncExecutor;
    ///
    /// #[tokio::main]

    ///     let executor = create_async_executor();

/// Shutdownable executor trait
///
/// Provides lifecycle management functionality similar to the JDK `ExecutorService` interface.
/// Executors implementing this trait can be gracefully shut down, waiting for executing tasks to complete.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - Graceful shutdown: The `shutdown()` method stops accepting new tasks but waits for submitted tasks to complete
/// - Immediate shutdown: The `shutdown_now()` method attempts to stop all executing tasks
/// - State queries: Can query whether the executor is shut down or terminated
///
