/// Synchronous Mutex Wrapper (Parking Lot)
///
/// Provides an encapsulation of synchronous mutex using parking_lot::Mutex
/// for protecting shared data in synchronous environments. Supports safe
/// access and modification of shared data across multiple threads.
/// Compared to std::sync::Mutex, parking_lot::Mutex provides better
/// performance and more ergonomic API.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - Synchronously acquires locks, may block threads
/// - Supports trying to acquire locks (non-blocking)
/// - Thread-safe, supports multi-threaded sharing
/// - Automatic lock management through RAII ensures proper lock
///   release
/// - Better performance compared to std::sync::Mutex
/// - More ergonomic API with no unwrap() calls
///
/// # Usage Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use qubit_concurrent::lock::{ArcMutex, Lock};
///
/// let counter = ArcMutex::new(0);
///
/// // Synchronously modify data
/// counter.write(|c| {
///     *c += 1;
///     println!("Counter: {}", *c);
/// });
///
/// // Try to acquire lock
/// if let Ok(value) = counter.try_read(|c| *c) {
///     println!("Current value: {}", value);
/// }
/// ```
