/// Synchronous Mutex Wrapper
///
/// Provides an encapsulation of synchronous mutex for protecting
/// shared data in synchronous environments. Supports safe access and
/// modification of shared data across multiple threads.
///
/// # Features
///
/// - Synchronously acquires locks, may block threads
/// - Supports trying to acquire locks (non-blocking)
/// - Thread-safe, supports multi-threaded sharing
/// - Automatic lock management through RAII ensures proper lock
///   release
///
/// # Usage Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use prism3_rust_concurrent::lock::{ArcMutex, Lock};
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// let counter = ArcMutex::new(0);
/// let counter = Arc::new(counter);
///
/// // Synchronously modify data
/// counter.with_lock(|c| {
///     *c += 1;
///     println!("Counter: {}", *c);
/// });
///
/// // Try to acquire lock
/// if let Some(value) = counter.try_with_lock(|c| *c) {
///     println!("Current value: {}", value);
/// }
/// ```
