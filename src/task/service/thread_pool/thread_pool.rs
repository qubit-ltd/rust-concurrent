/// `ThreadPool` accepts fallible tasks, stores them in an internal FIFO queue,
/// and executes them on worker threads. Workers are created lazily up to the
/// configured core size, queued after that, and may grow up to the maximum size
/// when a bounded queue is full. Submitted tasks return [`TaskHandle`], which
/// supports both blocking [`TaskHandle::get`] and async `.await` result
/// retrieval.
///
/// `shutdown` is graceful: already accepted queued tasks are allowed to run.
/// `shutdown_now` is abrupt: queued tasks that have not started are completed
/// with [`TaskExecutionError::Cancelled`](crate::task::TaskExecutionError::Cancelled).
